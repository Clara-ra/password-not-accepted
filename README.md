# My Awesome Project
WORK IN PROGRESS
Making passwords should be easy, right? Except it's not. I was inspired to make this after being prompted to make a password by a site that had various inane requirements that did not really help me ensure my account would be kept [safe.](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sec5) See if you can successfully make a password...

**Link to project:** TBD

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I thought it would be overkill to use anything more complex than vanilla javascript. The content itself is very minimal, as it simply provides an input for the user to type in. The javascript uses a series of regular expressions, with increasing complexity to ensure the user is meeting all the rules. I have future plans to create a database to verify that the accepted password has not been used before. I also plan to add several more rules, as I think it is still too easy.

## Lessons Learned:

Regular Expressions are a fantastic tool for looking for various characters. Before this project I had no idea what a capturing group was, let alone how to form a simple regex beyond checking for letters.
